# Include Directory

This directory contains the public header files for the project. Organizing header files into a dedicated `include` directory is a widely adopted convention in C++ development, especially for projects that produce shared libraries such as `.dll` files. This practice offers several practical and architectural benefits that enhance maintainability, portability, and usability of the codebase.

## Purpose

The `include` directory is intended to hold all the public headers that define the interface of the library. These headers are meant to be used by consumers of the library to interact with its functionality.

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Interface and Implementation**
   - Placing headers in an `include` folder makes the separation between public interface and private implementation explicit. It reduces the risk of accidental dependencies on private implementation details.

2. **Improved Project Structure and Readability**
   - A well-organized directory structure improves the readability and navigability of a project. Developers can quickly locate the API definitions without sifting through implementation files.

3. **Facilitates Reuse and Distribution**
   - Having all public headers in a single `include` directory simplifies packaging and distribution. It makes it easier for consumers to integrate the library into their own projects by adding just one include path.

4. **Supports Scalable Build Systems**
   - Modern build systems benefit from a clear directory layout. An `include` directory can be easily added to the compiler’s include path, ensuring that headers are found without ambiguity.

5. **Encourages Good Encapsulation Practices**
   - By consciously deciding which headers go into the `include` folder, developers are encouraged to think about the public API design. This promotes better encapsulation and modularity.

## Best Practices

- Only place public headers in the `include` directory. Private headers should remain in the source directories.
- Ensure that the headers in the `include` directory are well-documented and provide a clear and concise API.
- Avoid including implementation details in the public headers. Use forward declarations where possible.
- Regularly review and refactor the headers to maintain a clean and efficient public interface.

By following these practices, the `include` directory will serve as a reliable and maintainable interface for the library, benefiting both developers and consumers of the project.
