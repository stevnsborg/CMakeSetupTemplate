# Library Details

Here you can describe the library in detail including the functionalities it adds and the intended use cases. The `CMakeLists.txt` file contains the build logic for the process that builds the library source into the module. This can be compiled independently if only a more recent version of the source is needed. This can be particularly useful for pragmatic adjustments in other projects that utilise this as a dependency to make it work in a pinch.
